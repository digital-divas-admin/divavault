# Consented AI — Full Overview

> Court-ready forensic evidence for deepfake cases.

## Company Overview

Consented AI is an AI likeness protection platform. We build documented, explainable evidence packages for deepfake cases that hold up in court. Our clients are attorneys, talent management firms, entertainment companies, and content removal specialists who need forensic-grade proof of unauthorized AI-generated likenesses.

## Core Service: Deepfake Forensic Evidence

Our evidence packages include:

- **Detection**: Continuous scanning of AI platforms (CivitAI, DeviantArt, Reddit, and 247+ additional sources) for unauthorized use of a person's face.
- **Attribution**: Linking detected deepfakes to specific AI models, training datasets, and distribution platforms.
- **Chain-of-Custody Documentation**: Timestamped, hash-verified records that satisfy legal standards for digital evidence admissibility.
- **Expert-Ready Reports**: Structured documentation designed for use by expert witnesses and legal counsel in court proceedings.

## Methodology

Our forensic methodology is designed for legal admissibility:

1. **Enrollment**: Individuals upload reference photos and verify their identity through KYC (Know Your Customer) checks.
2. **Facial Signature Creation**: We generate a unique facial embedding from verified reference images.
3. **Continuous Scanning**: Our scanner backend monitors AI content platforms for matches against enrolled facial signatures using cosine similarity matching.
4. **Match Verification**: Detected matches undergo quality scoring and human review before escalation.
5. **Evidence Packaging**: Confirmed matches are compiled into documented evidence packages with full provenance chains.
6. **Automated Takedowns**: DMCA takedown notices are filed automatically for confirmed unauthorized uses.
